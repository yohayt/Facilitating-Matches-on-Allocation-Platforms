Source code for ECAI 2025 paper: Facilitating Matches on Allocation Platforms
For running an experiment, use the python file with a name equal to the Figure id of the corresponding graph.

Folders:
images: storing the generated figures.
datasets: the input datasets.
output: the textual (intermediate) output files.
preprocess: the python classes for preprocessing the datasets.

Files:
FIG3.py, FIG4.py, FIG5_LEFT.py, FIG5_RIGHT.py: python classes for running the experiments and generating figures.
util.py: utility functions for running the internal logic.

For accelerating the runs, the map function could be easily replaced with the multiprocessing map function,
multiprocessing code was tested only in linux. the code itself works also in windows systems.

Required python packages: NetworkX, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, functools.
